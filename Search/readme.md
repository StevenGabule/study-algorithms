# Searching Algorithms
Question 1:Binary Search - Given an array of integers which is sorted in ascending order, and a target integer, write a function to search for whether the target integer is there in the given array. If it is there then return its index. Otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. 

Question 2:Search in Rotated Sorted array- You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed).  For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]. Given an integer target, return the index of target if it is in the array, else return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
