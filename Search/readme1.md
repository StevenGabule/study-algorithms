# Searching Algorithms
Question 1:Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array-You are given an array of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1]. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Question 2:Search in 2D Array-Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.

The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

If the value is there in the matrix return true, else false.
